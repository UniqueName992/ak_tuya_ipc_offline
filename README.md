A patched binary to launch the rtsp service even if the camera is not able to connect to Tuya cloud.

The model I used is this one, but it may work with other Tuya-based cameras :

The bash script allows to flash the camera without modifying the firmware permanently. I have not tried to do so, so feel free to open a pull request if you do.

### How to :
- Configure the camera with the Tuya app so that it connects to your Wi-Fi
- Firewall the camera completely so that it cannot establish any connection

To configure until reboot:
- Use the rtsp.sh script to use the custom binary (you will have to modify the TELNET_IP variable in the file)

Or use an SD Card formatted to FAT32:
- copy tmp_test.sh and ak_tuya_ipc onto the SD Card
- Configure an IP address for getting the time (e.g. your router)
- Power off the camera, plug the SD Card in, power back on

Then:
- Access the stream through rtsp://<CAMERA_IP>:554/jkstream
- Or use Onvif Device Manager

Good luck :-)
